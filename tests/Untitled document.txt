1. Networking Story in Story section : 

“I’m a therapist, and for a while I’m helping clients build healthy relationships… while my own love life is quietly falling apart. It’s three toxic relationships in a row—each one starts like fireworks, and each one ends with me staring at my phone, stomach in knots, trying to decode silence.


After the last breakup, I’m sitting on my bathroom floor with my back against the tub, mascara streaked, thinking, “I can’t keep being the woman who knows better and still chooses this.”


So I do what high-achievers do: I work harder. I journal, I analyze, I talk it through, I make rules—“pick better,” “watch the red flags,” “don’t get attached.” But the pull is still there. The second someone is inconsistent, something in me lights up like, finally.


The wake-up call hits when I realize: I can explain relationship patterns all day and still be living one. My brain is brilliant. My body is terrified. And my body is choosing what feels familiar, not what’s good.


That sends me back into research—attachment theory, nervous system regulation, trauma bonding—and it clicks: I’m not broken. I’m running an old program.


The breakthrough is realizing I’m not actually attracted to chaos—I’m conditioned to mistake it for love. The real work is teaching my nervous system that steady can be safe.


I start combining talk therapy with somatic work and practical dating strategy, and I learn to tolerate the “boring” stability without self-sabotaging. Within eight months, I meet my husband—consistent, open, fully available. Now I help successful professional women in their 30s and 40s heal the pattern, build secure attachment behaviors, and attract a loving, committed partner using the Secure Attraction Method.”

Doesn’t provide Pit and Search and all, maybe should be more nicely provided.
