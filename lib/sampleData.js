    industry: "Executive Health & Performance Coaching",

    // 2. Target Audience
    idealClient: "Busy male CEOs, founders, and executives over 40 who have sacrificed their health for wealth and want to regain their energy and physique without spending hours in the gym or following restrictive diets.",

    // 3. Core Message
    message: "I help high-performing executives reclaim their energy, lose 20+ lbs, and double their productivity in 90 days without spending hours in the gym or eating boring diets.",

    // 4. Core Problem
    coreProblem: "They are burnt out, have low energy, carry visceral belly fat, and fear a health crisis will derail their business success. They've tried gyms, diets, and fitness apps but nothing sticks because traditional fitness advice doesn't work for busy schedules.",

    // 5. Outcome/Result
    outcomes: "Lose 20-30lbs of stubborn fat, gain all-day sustained energy, sleep 7+ hours deeply, improve cognitive focus for faster decision-making, and build a sustainable lifestyle that sets a good example for their family and team.",

    // 6. Unique Advantage/Mechanism
    uniqueAdvantage: "The 'Metabolic CEO Method' - a data-driven protocol that combines 20-minute micro-workouts, bloodwork analysis, and circadian rhythm optimization specifically designed for executives with packed schedules.",

    // 7. Personal Story (6 parts)
    storyLowMoment: "I was a corporate executive working 80 hours a week until I collapsed from exhaustion at 35. Doctors said I was pre-diabetic with high blood pressure. I looked in the mirror and didn't recognize myself—40 pounds overweight, exhausted, and scared I'd miss my kids growing up.",
    storyDiscovery: "I spent months trying everything—personal trainers, meal prep services, meditation apps. Nothing worked because they all assumed I had 2 hours a day to exercise and prep food. I didn't have 2 hours, I barely had 20 minutes.",
    storySearchAgain: "Then I started researching what the world's top CEOs actually did. I discovered that most successful executives don't follow traditional fitness—they optimize. Short intense workouts. Strategic nutrition. Sleep as a performance tool.",
    storyBreakthrough: "The breakthrough came when I combined metabolic science with executive scheduling. 20-minute workouts. Meals that could be ordered at any restaurant. Sleep optimization based on my travel schedule. Within 90 days, I dropped 30 pounds and had more energy than I did in my 20s.",
    storyBigIdea: "The core truth I discovered is that busy people don't need more willpower—they need systems designed for their lifestyle. Traditional fitness fails executives because it's built for people with time, not people with power.",
    storyResults: "Now I've helped 500+ executives transform their health without sacrificing their careers. CEOs running marathons. Founders getting off blood pressure meds. VCs with six-packs for the first time in decades.",

    storyDiscovery: "I tried hiring but kept getting burned. I'd train someone for weeks, they'd make mistakes, clients would complain, and I'd end up doing the work myself anyway. I thought maybe I just wasn't meant to scale.",
    storySearchAgain: "Then I studied how the biggest agencies operated. I realized they didn't hire for skills—they hired for culture and trained for skills. They didn't hope people would perform—they built systems that made failure impossible.",
    storyBreakthrough: "The breakthrough was building a 'Success System' before hiring a single person. Documented playbooks. Video SOPs. Clear metrics. Quality checklists. When new hires joined, they couldn't fail because the system wouldn't let them. Within 6 months, my agency tripled and I worked 25 hours a week.",
    storyBigIdea: "The truth is: you can't hire your way out of chaos. If your delivery is disorganized, your team will be too. The system comes first, then the people. Most agencies have it backwards.",
    storyResults: "Now I've helped 200+ agency owners escape the delivery trap. Clients going from $30K to $150K months. Owners taking month-long sabbaticals. Teams running better without the founder than with them.",

    storyDiscovery: "Instead of quitting, I studied what the successful stores were doing differently. I realized they weren't guessing at products—they were using data. They weren't competing on price—they were building brands. The gurus were teaching 2018 tactics in 2023.",
