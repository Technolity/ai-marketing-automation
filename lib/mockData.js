    hook: "If you're a real estate agent tired of the feast-or-famine cycle... constantly wondering where your next deal will come from... and frustrated with expensive ads that don't deliver—then pay close attention to what I'm about to share.",
    
    storyIntro: "Three years ago, I was exactly where you might be right now. Spending thousands on Facebook ads. Getting likes and comments but no actual leads. Working 60-hour weeks just to maintain my pipeline. Until I discovered a simple system that changed everything...",
    
    problemAgitate: "Here's the truth nobody tells you: Traditional lead generation is broken. You're throwing money at ads hoping something sticks. You're chasing cold prospects. You're competing on price because you have no other way to differentiate yourself. And worst of all—you have ZERO predictability in your business.\n\nEvery month feels like starting from scratch. You can't plan. You can't scale. You're stuck on the hamster wheel.",
    
    solutionReveal: "But what if there was a better way? What if you could wake up every morning knowing exactly how many leads you'll get this month? What if your calendar filled automatically with qualified prospects who are ready to work with you?\n\nThat's exactly what our 90-Day Predictable Pipeline System does. It's not magic—it's a proven, data-driven method that's generated over 10,000 qualified leads for agents just like you.",
    
    mechanismExplain: "Here's how it works: First, we build your done-for-you ad campaigns using our proven templates that have generated $50M+ in real estate transactions. Second, you get weekly coaching to optimize your follow-up and close more deals. Third, we set up all the automation so leads flow into your CRM 24/7—even while you sleep.",

Mark, in Phoenix, doubled his database in 4 months and now has a 6-month pipeline of hot prospects. These aren't outliers—this is the system working exactly as designed.",
