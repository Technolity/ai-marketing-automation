Lead Magnet Prompt - To Create a Free Gift 


NOTE: Once you’ve run this prompt, choose ONE title for the Lead Magnet and delete the others. This will allow the AI to populate the ads, emails, etc. with the title.

Prompt:
Use the three tips from the VSL to create a five-page workbook that we will paste into Canva. We will use the workbook as a Lead Magnet. Use the following framework for each page:

The first page will be an introductory page. Please include a robust introductory paragraph, but do not list the three tips that about to be revealed. The introduction should be inspiring and should motivate the reader to continue. 

For the next section, Include a title for each tip-page.
Then include A three-sentence description of the tip.
Follow this with three bullet point benefits for applying the tip followed by a two sentence description/clarification for each bullet point.
Conclude the page with a reflection/application question about the personal benefits of applying that tip in their context. 

The final page should include a robust, inspiring, and motivating summary. Then the page should conclude with a short paragraph that includes a call to action to schedule a consultation call [use the call title the client used in the VSL]. Then the final paragraph should be center justified and simply say Click Here to Schedule your Call.

If the lead magnet has a title already, then skip the following instructions. Otherwise, please provide six marketable titles for this workbook. Two should be humorous, two should be controversial, and two should be professional.

FB ShortForm Ads Prompt

Prompt: Use the VSL and create 10 Facebook ads. Use the template below using data from the VSL. Write compelling facebook ads that communicate powerfully to the target audience. Be sure not to skimp on social proof and personal details - provide enough background details to make their use compelling. Use professional emojis throughout the emails as well.



FB Ad Template for Chat GPT 

A headline that hooks the audience with a question or a powerful statement that’s related to a major pain point.

A Call to action right away to access the lead magnet (use one of the titles from the Lead Magnet Workbook).

Share 3 benefits that will excite the client about accessing the training. Include a one sentence explanation for each point.

Insert Stats or personal journey of the creator of the video script . This should be at least two sentences long.


Include one powerful social proof – be sure to include enough background details to make the proof compelling. 

Call to action to opt in for the free training – this should be one or two powerful sentences

Sign off with something inspirational to make client feel part of a community.

Remember to write conversationally, using complete sentences for each section of the template., and do not include headers or subheaders ... I should be able to cut and paste the ad directly into Facebook.


FB LongForm Ads Prompt
THE PROMPT


Use the Intake and VSL document to write ten long-form Facebook ads. When writing this ad the hook should have 1) a time frame 2) make it easy or effortless 3) speak to the burning desire of the customer or address the nagging problem ......... Please use the framework below to write ten longtail, robust Facebook ads. Do not include section headings so that each ad is copy-and-paste ready. Please use emojis throughout.


1. Attention-Grabbing Headline (Hook)
Highlight a Major Result + Timeframe
Example: "How I Generated $40 Million in High-Ticket Sales with This Unique Funnel that Floods Your Business with Appointments in Just 14 Days!"
Or: "Flood Your Business with High-Quality Leads in 14 Days Using This Unique High-Ticket Sales Funnel!"

2. Imagination Prompt (Problem + Emotional Pain)
Start with a relatable problem or frustration that connects emotionally.
Example: "Have you ever asked yourself, why does my marketing fail to bring in high-ticket clients?"
The alarm goes off early, and you’re hit with that soul-sucking feeling that you’re not getting enough high-ticket clients for your coaching or service business. Payroll’s tight, the bills are piling up, and you keep asking—what’s wrong with my business?"
3. Personal Struggle (Relatable Story)
Share a personal struggle, a story that shows vulnerability, and builds connection.
Example: "I’ve been there. A decade ago, I was lost, trying every marketing tactic under the sun—social media, paid ads, podcasts, email marketing—none of it worked. I was bleeding money on ads and ready to quit."
Then, I found the 3 secret ingredients that changed everything and turned my confusion into a $40 million high-ticket sales funnel."

4. Highlight the Unique Solution (Benefits + Big Promise)
Introduce the solution (your system) and emphasize the transformation.
Example: "I’ve taken those 3 secret ingredients and turned them into a powerful, high-ticket sales funnel that 20x’s lead generation for my clients and floods their business with high-quality appointments in just 14 to 30 days."
"When combined with AI, this strategy has clients begging to pay you five or six figures in dozens of industries."

5. Paint the Picture of Success (Visualize the Result)
Show a clear, desirable outcome that your audience can picture.
Example: "Imagine launching this funnel in just 3 days and seeing your calendar fill up with appointments in 14 to 30 days—high-quality prospects ready to pay $2,000, $10,000, or even $100,000 for your services."

6. Set a Clear Qualification (Exclusivity)
Define who this is for and create exclusivity, pushing away unqualified prospects.
Example: "This isn’t for everyone. If your service or program is under $2,000, or if you’re not aiming for multi-six to seven-figure revenue, this may not be the right fit."
"But if you offer services priced at $2,000, $10,000, $50,000, or beyond $100,000, you’re going to love this."

7. Call to Action (CTA with Urgency)
Encourage immediate action, driving urgency and making the offer appealing.
Example: "Ready to launch a high-ticket sales funnel that floods your business with leads and high-paying clients? Click here to get started."

8. Bonus (P.S. or Final Hook)
Add a final punch or bonus information to overcome common objections or create a personal connection.
Example: "P.S.: You’re paying $500 to $1,000 for luxury items like Gucci or Louis Vuitton, but underpricing your own services. It’s time to value your expertise!"



This is the actual ad that is being modeled above with a formula that can be used by clients 

AN EXAMPLE OF A HIGH CONVERTING AD

How I did 40 million in high ticket sales with this unique new marketing funnel that floods your business with high quality appointments within as little as 14 days. 
Have you ever asked yourself the question, why does my marketing suck so bad?
The alarm goes off early in the morning with the soul sucking feeling that you're not getting enough high ticket clients for your coaching or service business. 
You're short on payroll at the end of the month, and you're constantly sitting with the problem- what is wrong with my business and why can't I do it like the guy I see on youtube or Facebook.
I've been there, I was so confused a decade ago, trying too many marketing ideas, social media, paid ads, podcasts, email, chasing clients, and none of them worked…
I was bleeding money on ads, and ready to just give up, and then I scoured the planet to find the 3 secret ingredients I needed to get high ticket clients every day.
A decade later I turned those 3 secret ingredients into a 40 million dollar high ticket sales funnel with this unique new strategy that will shatter results in dozens of industries
This unique new funnel 20x the lead generation for my clients and floods your business with high quality appointments within 14 to 30 days. 
When coupled with ai, i have helped brands in dozens of different industries, launch a new high ticket funnel that has clients begging to have you 5 and six figure checks  -
Imagine launching the funnel within 3 days, and having your calendar flooded with appointments in 14 to 30 days.
If you don't have a service or program priced at $2000 and above and if you're not at multi six figures to 7 or 8 figures then this is not for you.
But if you have a service that is $2000, $10,000, $50,000 or beyond $100,000 then you will love this….
https://m2m.tedmcgrathbrands.com/fb-rtg-ai-x-incubator
P.S: we always help brands double their pricing so don't worry, you're off paying $500 to $1000 for Gucci or louis shoes, yet you are underpricing your own services or programs.. Crazy!!!!!!

Remember to write 10 ads and make sure they are longtail ads that are similar in style and scope to the example above.

Remember, this isn’t just a call; it’s the start of something amazing."
[Expectations and Preparation] "Come prepared with your questions, concerns, and aspirations. This is your time, and I want to make sure we use every minute effectively."
[Encouragement with Humor – use the client’s profession, personality, or program to make this specific for the client.] "Plus, you don't want to miss my [light-hearted humorous remark, e.g., 'terrible jokes' or 'doodle collection']. Trust me, it’ll be worth it!"
[Call to Action] "So, mark your calendar, set an alarm, tie a string around your finger—whatever it takes. I can’t wait to chat with you and start this journey together."

Appointments to Show Up - Email & Text Sequence
Prompt: We are going to write a sequence of emails and text messages to ensure that a client shows up for their scheduled appointment. The client has booked a free consultation and the goal is to create a reminder sequence to make sure they show up to the free consultation..... There should be several email reminders and the first one will be sent immediately upon booking the free consultation. The first email should be something like, “Congrats, you're free consultation is booked..... If you haven't watched this video, be sure to watch the video in full or as much as you can before the free consultation”..... Then second email will be sent 48 hours before the consult to remind them that their free consult is coming up, and in that email, you would lay out the steps of the program and let them know this is what we're gonna be talking about on the free consult... Then send another email 24 hours out... It's another reminder... And it should share with them different success stories of clients.... Then, several other reminders on the day of the consultation are sent the morning of the appointment, one hour before the appointment, 10 minutes before the appointment, and the last one is to remind them the consult is starting now........ The purpose of these emails is to remind them to show up and give them content that will inspire them to show up, success stories that inspire them to show up, and reminders of what's going to be accomplished on the free consultation to inspire them to show up stats about me to remind them to show up...... So please use the video sales letter script to write the emails using the framework below.
